git

git status
	- Gives status of files
	- Red = not being tracked (meaning not added and wont be pushed to origin branch)
	- Green = being tracked (meaning will get added to origin branch)

	- When you add '.' you say track all of this
	- If you add instead "main.py" then you are specifying that file

git commit
	- Commit message so that it can get pushed
	- Can do multiple commits
	- If add "-m" then followed by message in quotation marks it will be like message to see

git push origin
	- Pushes updates to branch
	- "origin" branch is your website branch, your main branch
	- Once you push all updates are gone and you will have to do new commits and new status's for more push

git pull origin
	- Updates your code from the origin branch
	- Always do this before git commit


Always push updates so that you are always up to date
